# Future Ideas for IndexAccess

## Core Features
- **Automatic Index Discovery**: Scan database schema on Rails boot to automatically generate scopes
- **Index Usage Analytics**: Track which generated scopes are actually used to identify unused indexes
- **Query Plan Validation**: Verify that generated scopes actually use the intended indexes via EXPLAIN
- **Multi-Database Support**: Handle applications with multiple databases and connection pools

## Developer Experience
- **Rails Generator**: `rails generate index_access:install` to set up configuration
- **Scope Preview**: CLI tool to preview what scopes would be generated without modifying models
- **Index Suggestions**: Analyze slow queries and suggest indexes that could benefit from IndexAccess
- **Documentation Generation**: Auto-generate API docs showing all available index scopes per model

## Advanced Querying
- **Partial Index Conditions**: Smart handling of WHERE clauses in partial indexes
- **Index Intersection**: Combine multiple single-column indexes intelligently
- **Covering Index Optimization**: Use covering indexes to avoid table lookups entirely
- **Range Query Optimization**: Better support for BETWEEN, >, <, etc. on indexed columns

## Performance & Monitoring
- **Query Performance Metrics**: Built-in benchmarking of index scope vs regular scope performance
- **Index Health Monitoring**: Track index usage, bloat, and maintenance needs
- **Query Cache Integration**: Leverage Rails query cache more effectively with predictable scope names
- **Background Index Analysis**: Periodic jobs to analyze query patterns and suggest optimizations

## Database-Specific Features
- **PostgreSQL Extensions**: Support for GIN, GiST, and other specialized index types
- **MySQL Optimization**: Handle MySQL-specific index hints and optimizations
- **SQLite Compatibility**: Lightweight mode for development/testing with SQLite

## Integration & Ecosystem
- **GraphQL Integration**: Auto-generate GraphQL resolvers that use index scopes
- **API Documentation**: Integration with tools like Swagger to document optimized endpoints
- **Monitoring Tools**: Integration with New Relic, DataDog, etc. for index performance tracking
- **Migration Helpers**: Tools to safely add/remove indexes with corresponding scope updates

## Developer Tools
- **Index Scope Linting**: RuboCop rules to encourage index scope usage over manual queries
- **Performance Regression Detection**: CI integration to catch queries that stopped using indexes
- **Visual Query Planner**: Web interface showing query execution plans for generated scopes
- **Index Usage Heatmap**: Visual representation of which indexes/scopes are used most frequently

## Edge Cases & Robustness
- **Polymorphic Association Handling**: Smart scoping for polymorphic relationships
- **Soft Delete Integration**: Automatic handling of acts_as_paranoid and similar gems
- **Multi-Tenant Support**: Scope generation that respects tenant isolation
- **Dynamic Schema Handling**: Support for applications that modify schema at runtime
